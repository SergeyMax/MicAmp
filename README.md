# MicAmp
 Balanced Low Noise Dynamic Microphone Preamp
 
 Based on the low noise MC33079 quad operational amplifier. USB powered isolated power supply was used to avoid ground looping. The diagram and PCB layout were prepared using DipTrace. Board was fitted to the G1906 Gainta plastic enclosure.
 
 Gain at 1 kHz = 240
 
 Output noise voltage (RMS) = 200uV
